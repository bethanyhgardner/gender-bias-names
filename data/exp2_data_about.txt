	Participants wrote their gender in a free-response box. NA values (N=88) are participants who did not 
	provide a gender, generally misreading the question and writing their age instead. This is the variable
	used in the supplementary analysis, with male participants (N=694) coded as 1 and female (N=566), 
	genderqueer (N=1), and nonbinary (N=2) participants are coded as 0. The original responses are not 
	included in the public dataset, to preserve the privacy of gender minority participants.

Participant age, education level, and race/ethnicity were also collected but are not included in the 
public dataset.
