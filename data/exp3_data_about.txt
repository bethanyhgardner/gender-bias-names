	Participants wrote their gender in a free-response box. NA values (N=116) are participants who did not 
	provide a gender, generally misreading the question and writing their age instead. This is the variable
	used in the supplementary analysis, with male participants (N=514) coded as 1 and female (N=638), 
	nonbinary (N=2), agender (N=1), and asexual (N=1) participants are coded as 0. The original responses are not 
	included in the public dataset, to preserve the privacy of gender minority participants.
 
Participant age, education level, and race/ethnicity were also collected but are not included in the 
public dataset.
